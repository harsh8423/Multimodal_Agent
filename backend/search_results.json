      "selftext": "Everyone's obsessed with building the next \"Devin\" or some god like autonomous agent. It's a huge waste of time for 99% of developers and businesses.\n\nAfter spending the last 18 months in the space building these things for actual clients, I can tell you the pattern is painfully obvious. The game changing agents aren't the complex ones. They're basically glorified scripts with an LLM brain attached.\n\nThe agents that clients happily pay five figures for are the ones that do one boring thing perfectly:\n\n- An agent that reads incoming support emails, categorizes them, and instantly replies to the top 3 most common questions. This saved one client from hiring another support rep.\n- A simple bot that monitors five niche subreddits, finds trending problems, and drafts a weekly \"market pain points\" email for the product team.\n- An agent that takes bland real estate listings and rewrites them to highlight the emotional triggers that actually make people book a viewing.\n\nThe tech isn't flashy. The results are.\n\nThis is the part nobody advertises:\n\n1.  The build is the easy part. The real job starts after you launch. You'll spend most of your time babysitting the agent, fixing silent failures, and explaining to a client why the latest OpenAI update broke their workflow. (Pro tip: Tools like Blackbox AI have been a lifesaver for quickly debugging and iterating on agent code when things break at 2 AM.)\n\n2.  You're not selling AI. You are selling a business outcome. Nobody will ever pay you for a \"RAG pipeline.\" They will pay you to cut their customer response time in half. If you lead with the tech, you've already lost the sale.\n3.  The real skill is being a detective. The code is getting commoditized and AI coding assistants like Blackbox AI can help you prototype faster than ever. The money is in finding the dumb, repetitive task that everyone in a company hates but nobody thinks to automate. That's where the gold is.\n\nIf you seriously want to get into this, here's my game plan:\n\n- Be your own first client. Find a personal workflow that's a pain in the ass and build an agent to solve it. If you can't create something useful for yourself, you have no business building for others.\n- Get one case study. Find a small business and offer to build one simple agent for free. A real result with a real testimonial is worth more than any fancy demo.\n- Learn to speak \"business.\" Translate every technical feature into hours saved, money earned, or headaches removed. Practice this until it's second nature.\n\nThe market is flooded with flashy, useless agents. The opportunity isn't in building smarter AI; it's in applying simple AI to the right problems.\n\nWhat's the #1 \"boring\" problem you think an AI agent could solve in your own work?\n\n",

      "selftext": "2013: Built a website. A classified ads site for Udemy courses.  \nCoded every line myself.  \nLaunch day visitors: Zero.\n\n2015: Built IT admin tools. Actually useful. Used them at my job.  \nSales: Zero.\n\n2016: Quit my job with 1 year of savings. (Don't do this)  \nIncome: Still zero.\n\nYou know what all these had in common?  \nI was terrified of marketing.\n\nHere's the truth nobody tells you:  \nYou can build the most beautiful product on Earth.  \nNobody cares if they don't know it exists.  \nMarketing is 80% of any business.  \nProduct is 20%.  \nI had it completely backwards.\n\nThe $12 that changed everything!\n\n2017: Finally recorded my first course.  \n30 minutes. Voice only. Quality was garbage.  \nI was Too shy to show my face.  \nBut the topic had zero competition on Udemy (*Topic: IIS Web Server*)  \nFirst sale: $12.  \nThat notification hit different.  \nNot because of the money.  \nBecause someone, somewhere, found value in what I created.\n\nHere's what actually worked:  \nStarted a YouTube channel.  \nOne video.  \nRanked #1  \nHit $300/month.  \nThen I did the dumbest thing possible...  \nI tried to build everything at once  \nH-educate (now LearnWithHasan) - jumped between:\n\nEmail marketing, Make money online, Affiliate Marketing, Mining...  \nWhatever was trending\n\nGuess what happened?  \nNothing stuck.  \nI was trying to juggle 10 balls when I couldn't hold one.\n\nThe lesson that made me profitable:  \nFOCUS ON ONE PROJECT AT A TIME.\n\nGet it to $1k/month (at least)  \nThen move to the next.  \nSounds simple?  \nIt is.\n\nBut your brain will fight you.  \n\"What if this other idea is better?\"  \n\"What if I'm missing out?\"  \n\"What if someone else does it first?\"  \nFight back.\n\nToday, 11 years later:  \nLearnWithHasan  \nToolerbox  \nSimplerLLM  \n\\~1M YouTube subscribers  \n100K+ students on Udemy\n\nBut here's the thing...  \nI'm not a millionaire.  \nNo Lamborghini.  \nNo \"quit your job in 30 days\" BS.  \nJust stable income doing what I love.  \nNo boss. No meetings. No asking permission to live.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth:  \nMost of you reading this are better developers than me.  \nSmarter than me.  \nMore talented than me.\n\nBut you're making the same mistake I did:  \nHiding behind your keyboard.  \nPerfecting your code.  \nAvoiding the one thing that matters.  \nTelling people you exist.\n\nStop waiting for:  \nThe perfect product  \nThe perfect timing  \nThe perfect audience  \nThe perfect anything\n\nStart with:  \nOne terrible product  \nOne awkward post  \nOne bad video  \nOne embarrassing launch\n\nMy first everything was garbage.  \nYours will be too.  \nThat's the point.\n\nThe real difference between you and successful builders?  \nThey shipped their garbage.  \nYou're still polishing yours.  \nHere's what you do TODAY:\n\nPick ONE project (not three, ONE)  \nBuild the most basic version possible  \nTell 10 people about it  \nGet rejected by 9  \nLearn from the 1 who cared  \nRepeat tomorrow\n\nNo courses needed.  \nNo masterminds.  \nNo morning routines.  \nJust build, share, learn, repeat.\n\nThe best part?  \nYou don't need 11 years like I did.  \nWith AI today, you can do in months what took me years.\n\nI built SimplerLLM in 2 weeks.  \nAlready helping thousands.\n\nThe game has changed.  \nBut the rules haven't:  \nStop building in secret.  \nStart selling in public.  \nEven if it's terrible.  \nEspecially if it's terrible.  \nBecause that first $12?  \nIt's not about the money.  \nIt's about proving you can.  \nAnd once you prove you can make $12...  \n$120 is just repetition.  \n$1,200 is just scale.  \n$12,000 is just systems.  \nBut $0?  \n$0 is just fear.  \nStop being 2013 me.  \nStart being the you who ships today.\n\nCurrently building project #10 and still scared every launch.\n\nThe fear never goes away. You just learn to ship anyway.",

Upload all project briefs, meeting notes, and email chains. This allows any team member to ask, \"What was the final decision made about the project budget?\" and get an instant, sourced answer.\n\nHope this list is as helpful for you as it was for me to put together. Pick one or two that catch your eye and invest 15 minutes today. Small, consistent learning is how you get ahead.\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone,\nI recently registered FixMyCodeAI.com and I’d love to hear your thoughts on its potential value.\nWe’re in this new “vibe coding” era, where developers are leaning on AI tools, generating messy code, and then needing quick fixes or cleanup solutions. A lot of startups are already building AI-driven debugging, code review, and optimization platforms.\nThe name FixMyCodeAI feels pretty direct, brandable, and on-trend – it instantly tells you what the service does. My thought is that it could be appealing for a startup building AI-powered debugging, code cleanup, or developer tools.\nWhat do you think – does this domain hold good potential in the current market? How would you appraise it?\nThanks in advance for your feedback!",
