He broke his own record of having the highest Codeforces rating in India.\n\nHe is now just 17 rating points short of giving India its first Legendary Grand Master.\n\nFun fact: He still has 1 attempt left at ICPC World Finals. There has never been a better opportunity for India to do this well at ICPC.\n\nRooting really hard for him.",
